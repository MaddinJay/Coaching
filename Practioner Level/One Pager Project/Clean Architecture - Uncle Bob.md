# What is the book about?
In Clean Architecture Robert C. Martin describe paradigmen for reaching the goal of needing minimal human resources for development and maintaining soft-ware.  

# What are the main blocks?
![Summary - Clean Architecture](https://github.com/MaddinJay/Coaching/blob/main/Practioner%20Level/One%20Pager%20Project/Images/Clean_Architecture_(1).jpg)

The key learnings from this book are three paradigmen that leads to clean architecture. Those are:
- Functional programming. Software is build out of messaging.
- Structured programming which is reached by functional decomposition "from up drill down"
- Objectoriented programming. 

Additional key learnings are:
- Keep a slow and steady speed to rech sustainability
- Take "responsability" for functionality and structure of the soft-ware. Build a "greater value" and satisfy the requirements.

# My opinion on this book
The book supports the philosophy of building sustainable soft-ware that is maintainable and need minimal human resources for feature development. The focus of any developer should be gaining knowledge and go for self-improvement. Uncle Bob interprets design and architecture of software as the same which makes sense for me. As a sustainable software engineer I find strong support in the philosophy Uncle Bob presents here.
