# What is the book about?
Mark Seemann decribes in his book "Code that fits in your head" the need of reducing complexity in the code. He makes clear and repeats it thorughout the book, 
that "abstraction" is one of the key elements in building good software. He shows tools and techniques to reduce complexity and the overload in the reader's mind. 
The book can be understood as a summary of some of the principles we learned in this cocahing program.

The key learnings from this book are the importance of reducing complexity in coding. The key learnings are:
- Focus on "Abstraction": Things that change at the same rate belong together, those which does not, have to be split.
- Tools to abstract coding are: Value the Cohesion, Decompistion, Separation of Concerns.
- Break down Complexity by: Measuring Cyclomatic Complexity, "just" 7 things to handle at once.
- Work for sustainability: Work in continouse pace, make breaks, use Pomodoro, construct pure functions, guide the reader
- Do it Feedback-Driven: For troubleshooting create "minimal example", build "vertical slices", use "Postel's Law"

# My opinion on this book
Code that fits in your head is a wonderful summary of all the learnings in this coaching program. The book does not explain something super new, but by reading it
things and principles are manifest better in my mind. This book comes at the right time, in the end of this program.
