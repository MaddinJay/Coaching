# What is the book about?
In Agile Software Development Robert C. Martin describes the root of Agile Development, The Agile Manifesto. He describes what he and his colleagues interprete as extreme programming 
and gives an overview of some principles, which are helpful to structure coding and being flexible.

The key learnings from this book are The Agile Manisto and the interpretation of agile development and extreme programming in daily business. My learnings are:
- Keeping the 4 principles from the Manifesto makes daily business much more robust and flexible.
- The human being is in the center of the development process: costumer requirements and communication between IT and BU (requirements, integration of people in process) and
between the developers (readable coding, sufficient documentation, teamwork) are keys for business success.
- Do not hide behind processes, keep value and goal in mind
- There are a lot of good principles which help me staying organized and producing good software.

# My opinion on this book
Agile Software Development is a good starting point to go into the field of agile programming. In an easy way Uncle Bob explains some helpful principles and the fundament of
creating stable, and robust software. The book helps me becoming aware of what is important in daily business: good communication, being flexible and not holding on processes, which 
does not help solving the problem.
