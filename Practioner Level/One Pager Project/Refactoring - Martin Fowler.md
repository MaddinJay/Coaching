# What is the book about?
Martin Fowler decribes in his book "Refactoring" the need to refactor the code over and over again. He describes what good code should include, and offers a list of refactoring toolings to do refactoring.

# What are the main blocks?
![Summary - Clean Code](https://github.com/MaddinJay/Coaching/blob/main/Practioner%20Level/One%20Pager%20Project/Images/Clean_Code_-_Uncle_Bob_-_Summary.jpeg)

The key learnings from this book are the importance of refactoring for the sustainability and maintanance of the system and how to process them. The key learnings are:
- Do refactoring "testdriven", by "Boy Scout's rule" and "Baby steps". Wear to hats, the one who refactors, or the one who adds new features. 
- There is a catalog to do refactorings for "functions, "variables", "objects" and to "handle inheritation"
- Thers is a catalog for "moving features"
- If possible refactoring should be automate. In ADT for Eclipse use short cuts to handle some of the refactorings steps.

# My opinion on this book
Refactoring is a powerful book which serves as reference book for daily work. It is well structured, and the list at the end of the book gives a wonderful overview of all the refactoring tools.
