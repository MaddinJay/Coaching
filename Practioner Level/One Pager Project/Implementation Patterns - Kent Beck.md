The key learning of this book is that there is a "ton of implementation patterns" which can be used to structure coding and to reduce maintanance costs. Additionally the learnings are:

- Use common communication tools to save energy and time

# My opinion on this book
This book is a powerful encyclopedie for implementation/design patterns. It solves as reference book. Kent Beck presents a lot of patterns and programming tipps and tricks which can be integrated in daily business. Have it at the fingertips.
