# What is the book about?
In "A philosophie on software design" John K. Ousterhout describes the nature of complexity and offers techniques to handle and minimize complexity. He offers an overview of "red flags" and "principles". 
He recommends using those principles, finding the red flags and focus on learning and finding alternative solutions.

# What are the main blocks?
![Summary - Clean Code](https://github.com/MaddinJay/Coaching/blob/main/Practioner%20Level/One%20Pager%20Project/Images/Clean_Code_-_Uncle_Bob_-_Summary.jpeg)

The key learnings from this book are some design principles which are easy to integrate and fundamental for me. These are:
- Communication: Coding is written for readers, not for self purpose. It should be understandable by "meaningful names", "abstraction" and by avoiding doing several things at a time ("Single Responsible Principle")
- Coding is to be maintained. Use Boy Scout Rule to improve it over and over again.
- Software is not designed up front, it is a living process. Decision are best made the latest moment in designing, because then the information access is the best.
- Good porgrammers are lookong what are the other good ones are doing and adapt their concepts (4 Rules of Kent Beck)

# My opinion on this book
Clean code was the first book I read about software engineering. It helped me to improve my skills with easy to integrate tools (SRP, DI, DIP, Unit Testing).
The book is easy to read, although the content could be presented in a shorter way. Now, as I summarize the content again after 3 years, I think the book
is a good starting point for teaching clean code. It contains a lot of good principles I can integrate in my daily business easily.
