# What is the book about?
In <strong>A philosophie on software design</strong> <em>John K. Ousterhout</em> describes the <strong>nature of complexity</strong> and offers techniques to handle and minimize complexity. He offers an overview of <strong>red flags</strong> and <strong>design principles</strong>. 
He recommends using those principles, finding the red flags and focus on learning and finding alternative solutions.

# What are the main blocks?
![Design Principles and red flags](https://github.com/MaddinJay/Coaching/blob/main/Practioner%20Level/One%20Pager%20Project/Images/A_philosophy_on_software_design_-_Design_Principles.jpeg)

The key learnings from this book are some design principles which are easy to integrate and fundamental for me. These are:
- Focus on <strong>learning</strong>
- Complexity is caused by dependencies and/or obscurity
- Break down complexity by finding the <strong>red flags</strong> and erase them
- Modules should be <strong>deep</strong>, not shallowed: <strong>Simple Interface, a lot of functionality</strong>
- <strong>Abstraction</strong> is key: Hide information behind simple interfaces
- Make it <strong>somewhat-general-purpose module</strong>
- <strong>Communicate well</strong> by using good names (not vague) and comments if needed. Add it immediately, there is no later
- <strong>Sustainability</strong> is key: Use 10-20% of time for refactoring/redesigning/finding alternative solutions

# My opinion on this book
In <strong>A philosophie on software design</strong> <em>John K. Ousterhout</em> provides with the decribed design principles and red flags a cook book how to deal with complexity and 
"smell" code. The book can be used for reviews of existing coding by finding the red flags and trying to eliminate them. The book gives a good summary of a lot of learned principles and techniques in the software engineering coaching program.
