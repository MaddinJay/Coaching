# What is the book about?
In <strong>Growing Object-Oriented software - guided by tests</strong> <em>Steve Freeman & Nat Pryce</em> describe building software by starting with the Walking Skeleton. They use an example to 
illustrate the process of London School of TDD and focus on testing which guides the enegineer through the creation process.

The key learnings from this book are the principle of London School of TDD (Ouside - In) by using the Walking Skeleton and TDD. Key learings are:
- Getting fast feedback by using the Walking Skeleton (London School of TDD)
- Focus on Communication with the user and between the objects (Web of Communication)
- Listen to the tests: If difficult to test or design tests, think about the productive domain design
- Use the reflcetion phase in TDD to improve design and if needed, adjust the testing strategy

# My opinion on this book
<em>Steve Freeman & Nat Pryce</em> describe in their book a powerful way to design a workflow in the very beginning of the construction of the software component. By using the 
Wlaking Skeleton we can get fast feedback from the user to improve the software and getting valuable informations. The two guys focus on TDD to design their software which is 
essential to keep access to the software component. Additionally the focus is on communication. We should not pass data, instead behavior and create a web of communication objects, as well
keep the communication with the user alive.
