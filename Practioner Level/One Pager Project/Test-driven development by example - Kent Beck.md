# What is the book about?
In <strong>Test-driven development by example</strong> <em>Kent Beck </em> focus on TDD and how to improve the development cycle. For Kent software engineering is like the Rubic's cube, there are thousands ways to solve it. 
For Kent the main focus should be on feedback and learning.

The key learning from this book is a feedback driven method which leads to fast results by getting feedback from tests, rethinking and user experience. The faster, 
the better. Additionally I learned:
- Focus on <strong>learning</strong> by feedback (by tests, by Restrospective, by afterwards perspective)
- Software Engineering is like Rubic's Cube: Make baby steps that lead to feedback/learning
- Add <strong>Outside Refactoring</strong> to the TDD cycle
- If no design idea, use Triangulation
- Follow your test-list: Starter Tests, Scaffolding Tests, Explanation Tests, Regression Tests. Be aware of fast feedback.
- Use Open/Close Principle

# My opinion on this book
In <strong>TDD by example</strong> <em>Kent Beck</em> describes his perspective of doing TDD. I can identify myself with his method. Do baby steps, get feedback, learn from your mistakes and 
do not think there is just one way to do the things right. As Clean code is very difficult to reach, focus should be on learning and improving skills. This is be done by
feedback, in all forms. Get it fast.
